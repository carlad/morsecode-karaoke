scene: two groups of two are on stage, not aware of each other's presence. One team sets up their arduino morse code equipment. The other team set up their equipment, then just relax in chairs. there is also the narrator with a scarf in her hair.

Team1A: are we ready to prepare the message?
Team1B: yes captain.

Team1 furiously tap out a message on morse code with a little button, that beeps the code. In the meantime, the Narrator narrates.

Narrator: In this post apocalyptic zombie apocalypse, it's a game of survival of the fittest. We will see soon who from these two gangs has what it takes to make it in this crazy mixed up world.

Team1B: Send the message captain?
Team1A: Make it so.

the cell phone from team2A rings and plays a soundclip that says: 'I challenge you to a duel'. team2 prepares their equipment to send a message.

Team2A: the time has come. send an affirmative message and prepare.
Team2B: yes captain.

the laptops are set up, one per team, with the screens projected. both start the program at the same time so that the startup message 'Morse Code Karaoke' flashes on the screen. 

Narrator: Are you ready for Morse Code Karaoke?

the narrator take the scarf off, shakes her hair ala Grease, says in time with the screens, 'ready, set, go!' and flings the scarf towards the audience as if starting a race. Team1B and Team2B are furiously playing the game. one of them wins, and celebrates. silly insults are welcome.

Narrator: I like a captain with a fast trigger finger.
